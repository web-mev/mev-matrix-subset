# mev-matrix-subset

A basic utility tool for subsetting matrix files (e.g. count/expression files).

By providing a set of observations/samples and/or features/rows, this tool will either remove or keep the selected samples. Useful for removing outliers or other samples you want to discard. Alternatively, choose set of samples you want to retain/keep and this will remove the others.
